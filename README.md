# Object Detection Project

Honestly, this is just a github repo for me to save my code, so I Can download it again in the future. If anyone's looking at this and would like to use it, go ahead.

Need an arduino and at least 2 servos, one for X and one for Y axis. The code will move the 2 servos until the face of a detected person is in the center of the screen.
The camera needs to be somehow attached to the 2 servos (In whatever way you'd like, as long as it moves with it).

Self-Notes:

Basic code for my project on Object Detection/Computer Vision with an Arduino Mega and a servo (So far)

**Requires:**
* opencv-python
* opencv-contrib-python
* cvlib
* pyfirmata
* tensorflow
* numpy (Should be installed with openCV)

------------------------------------------

Servo Wiring:
* Orange (Left) = PWM
* Grey (Right) = GND
* Red (Middle) = PWR
