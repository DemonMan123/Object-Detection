# Object Detection Project

Honestly, this is just a github repo for me to save my code, so I Can download it again in the future. If anyone's looking at this and would like to use it, go ahead.

Need an arduino and at least 2 servos, one for X and one for Y axis. The code will move the 2 servos until the face of a detected person is in the center of the screen.
The camera needs to be somehow attached to the 2 servos (In whatever way you'd like, as long as it moves with it).
